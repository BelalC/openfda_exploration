Exploring adverse drug reactions with reports from the OpenFDA API

As part of a toy challenge, I explored the FDA's database of adverse event reports via the OpenFDA web API: https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/. These reports contains general information about the report, patient information, a list of the drugs that the patient is taking, and a list of patient reactions. In this brief analyis, I explore this question (in addition to a few smaller sub-questions):
 
•	Are different adverse events reported in different countries? 

The code is in a Jupyter Notebook and includes both the API queries for downloading data, and for analysis/visualisation. and I have also included a few smaller external datasets that I used to analyse the data.
